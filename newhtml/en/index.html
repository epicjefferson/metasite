            <h2>Idea</h2>

            <p>The Meta-Piano Extended is a multimedia and interactive project of sonic character. The structure of the piano is physically and sonically intervened, dismantling the formal and traditional base inherited from the western musical system. The piece explores distinct possibilities of interaction, which span from physical contact, the interpretation of text and the manifestation of a programmed algorithm. This project, conceptualized by Epic Jefferson and Themis CÃ¡diz, was the winner of the Lexus Grant for Emerging Artists in Puerto Rico in 2012</p>

            <h2>Project</h2>

            <p>The piano is physically reconstructed using local materials and is intervened making use of accessible micro-controllers (Arduino), specially designed circuits, electro-mechanical components and the programming of a control system, which permits access over the internet. This project required the collaboration of team, whose skills span the fields of Sound Art, Electrical Engineering, Systems Programming, Carpentry, Digital Fabrication, Design and Physical Computing.</p>
